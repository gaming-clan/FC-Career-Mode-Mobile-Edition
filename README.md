## 🤔 Why This Project?

The football gaming community has long requested deep career mode experiences on mobile devices. While EA FC 26 offers comprehensive career modes on console (Manager Career, Player Career, and Create-a-Club), EA FC Mobile focuses primarily on card-collecting and quick matches, leaving a significant gap for players who want strategic, management-focused gameplay on mobile.

**This project aims to:**
- Provide the career mode depth that mobile football fans have been requesting
- Create an accessible, free alternative to expensive console gaming
- Demonstrate that complex simulation games can work on mobile platforms
- Build a community-driven football management experience
- Respect players' time and money (no pay-to-win mechanics)
